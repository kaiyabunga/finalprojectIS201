                <li>Monkeys are super smart — some use tools like sticks to get insects or stones to crack nuts.</li>
                <li>They live in complex social groups with leaders, alliances, and even drama (monkey soap operas are real).</li>
                <li>Monkeys live in Asia, Africa, and Central/South America — but not naturally in Australia or Europe.</li>
                <li>Tree-lovers (like spider monkeys) are called arboreal, while ground-dwellers (like baboons) are terrestrial.</li>
                <li>Howler monkeys are the loudest land animals — you can hear them from 3 miles away!</li>
                <li>Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and even use leaves as cups.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>🕺Why don’t monkeys play cards in the jungle?<br>
                    Because there are too many cheetahs!</li>
                <li>🍌 What do you call a monkey with a banana in each ear?<br>
                    Anything you want — he can’t hear you!</li>
                <li>🛍️ Why did the monkey go to the mall?<br>
                    He heard the bananas were half off!</li>
                <li>🚀 What did the monkey astronaut say?<br>
                    "Houston, we have a banana."</li>
